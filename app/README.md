# defold-lldebugger

Setup script that loads the [Local Lua Debugger](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tomblind.local-lua-debugger-vscode) runtime module for debugging in Visual Studio Code.

## Defold Setup
Open your game.project file and in the dependencies field under project add:
```
https://github.com/ts-defold/defold-lldebugger/archive/extension.zip
```

Require the lldebugger module and start the debugger in your main script.
*Typically you would want to do this as earlier as possible in your game's startup*
```lua
require("lldebugger.debug").start()
```

## VS Code Setup
1. Install the [Local Lua Debugger](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tomblind.local-lua-debugger-vscode) extension
2. Copy the `.vscode/launch.json` and `.vscode/defold.sh` files from the main branch of this repository into your defold project directory
3. Edit the `.vscode/launch.json` per the instructions [here](https://github.com/tomblind/local-lua-debugger-vscode)

## Launch
Set your breakpoints then launch the Debug configuration.
The `defold.sh` script will download a standalone `dmengine` and execute your game.project directly from VS Code.
You will need to continue using the Defold Editor to build your project though this will be updated in the future.

## About
This script loads the `lldebugger` module contained in the local lua debugger vscode extension, 
and if the debugger is running will execute the runtime script so that the debugger may attach 
to your game.

The `lldebugger` module will only load in debug builds and only executes if the debugger is running.
So you may safely leave the initalization code in your game when publishing.
